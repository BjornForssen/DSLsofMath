* Live coding part of week 2, lecture 2.

Reminder of learning outcomes

* organize areas of mathematics in DSL terms
    * "develop adequate notation for mathematical concepts"
    * "perform calculational proofs"

* Lecture 2.1 covered

* Propositional calculus (as a DSL)
    * boolean logic without quantifiers (And, Or, Implies, Not, False, True) but with named atoms
    * a syntax tree datatype |PC|
    * an evaluator: |eval :: PC -> Sem| where |Sem = Tab -> Bool| and |Tab = String -> Bool|
* A bit of Haskell
    * recursive functions through "wishful thinking" (one helper function per case)
    * higher order functions
    * type driven development (TDD)
* First order logic (FOL) (as a new DSL, extending PC)
    * adding a term language (for rationals, or sets, or ...)
    * extend names to n-ary predicates over terms
    * quantifiers: Forall and Exists
* Pure set theory (as a domain for FOL)
    * introducing Empty, Singleton, Union
    * cardinality and some examples

** Lecture 2.2 (today) we continue working on logic and proofs:

* Proofs (towards a DSL for proof terms)
    * building proof terms (AbstractFOL.lhs)
    * the meaning of Forall (as a gen. of And)
* Case study: sqrt 2 is not rational [proof by contradiction]
* Case study: p^q can be rational even when neither p nor q is
* Case study: the limit of a function [from maths text to types and logic]
* More Curryâ€“Howard: |Either a b| is |Or a b|, |(a,b)| is |And a b|
    * the tupling transform as example
* typed quantification
* pushing negation through other constructors
