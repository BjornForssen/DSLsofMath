* Admin:
** Course book (lecture notes) and github
+ new draft uploaded (minor fixes in Chapter 3)
+ don't trust copy/paste from the PDF - some problems with special characters and spacing
+ get the code from github instead, or type it in "by hand"
  Example: [[https://github.com/DSLsofMath/DSLsofMath/blob/master/L/01/E1_1.lhs][Exercise 1.1]] ([[https://github.com/DSLsofMath/DSLsofMath/blob/master/L/01/ExerciseSolutions/E1_1.lhs][solution]]), etc.
+ Strong recommendation: Read every word! (Week N = Chapter N)
** Mid-course evaluation meeting and course representatives
The mid-course evaluation meeting will take place 2021-02-03 at 13.15 in Zoom.

Student representatives:

| Prg | Namn               |
|-----+--------------------|
| D   | Simon Johansson    |
| D   | Fredrik Österström |
| TM  | Mats Richardson    |

Contact them (or the teaching team) if you want to provide feedback
about the course.

** Weekly exercises: (bonusuppgifter)
+ Week 1 Grading done (49 pass / 51 submitted) - good work!
+ Week 2 online
+ Week 3 online
** [[https://chalmers.instructure.com/courses/12458/assignments/30083][Assignment 1]]: (deadline 2021-02-02)
+ Group formation done
+ Tuesday 2020-02-02: Deadline
** Extra Haskell lectures online
+ based on student questions last week I added 3 new YouTube videos
  about Haskell and "type driven development": polymorphic functions,
  product types |(a,b)| and sum types |Either a b|
* Lecture 2.1 ([[https://jamboard.google.com/d/1Yr8Fy9-dfnN6gjX6bFaJH7M31Ue_JrJUEOlqTab5648/edit?usp=sharing][Jamboard L2.1]])
** Prop = Propositional Calculus (Satslogik)
+ syntax examples
+ truth tables
+ eval : Prop -> Table -> Bool
  type Table = Name -> Bool
** Proofs
+ proof rules
** Pure set theory (useful for [[https://chalmers.instructure.com/courses/12458/assignments/30083][Assignment 1]])
+ "untyped sets", "just sets all the way down"
+ Empty set, Singleton set constructor, {braces around enumeration}
+ Cardinality (number of elements)
+ Membership: x ∈ S
+ Union, Intersection - connection to logic through membership
+ Enumerating some sets (to get thinking started)
** [[file:Live_2_1_2021.lhs][Live coding (Prop)]] [if there is time]
* Lecture 2.2
** FOL = First Order Logic
+ extend Prop with predicates and quantifiers
** Proof examples
