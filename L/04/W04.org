** Assignment 1: most presentations done - deadline for fixes: Fri lunch (at 12:00)
** New "group set" for [[https://chalmers.instructure.com/courses/8975/assignments/10399][Assignment 2:]]
+ You have been assigned [[https://chalmers.instructure.com/courses/8975/pages/groups-for-assignments][new groups]] for A2
+ The reason for having two separate "group sets" is that we want you to practice your "math communication and collaboration skills" in different teams.
+ During this week you can still swap provided you preserve the invariant
+ Invariant: no two student who worked together in A1 work together in A2
    (Forall x, Forall y. not (SameGroup(A1,x,y)&&SameGroup(A2,x,y)))
      where SameGroup(X,x,y) = (x/=y) && Exists G \in X. (x \in G)&&(y \in G)
* Week 4, lecture 1: Compositional semantics (Homomorphisms)
** Homomorphism: H2(f,(+),(*)) = forall x, y. f(x+y) == f x * f y

In general, we have seen many examples of H2

  H2(f,(+),(*)) = forall x, y. f(x+y) == f x * f y

with
  f = eval
  a = Syntax type     and (+) = a syntactic constructor
  b = Semantic domain and (*) = semantic operator (function)

** To cover:
DONE (blackboard): Homomorphisms (exp, log, f:a->{0}, even)
DONE (blackboard): non-homomorphism (isPrime, -- not done: countWords)
